# Challenge - Flickr feed viewer and search

Write a simple web application that reads data from Flickr's public feeds and displays the images on the page to the user.
Please check the Flickr API documentation from the following URL:

- [Flickr]( http://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/)
- [Public feed](https://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne)


## Details

- Write a web application - backend built using JavaScript/NodeJS/ExpressJS and frontend developed using vanilla HTML5 or the framework of your choosing. 
- On page load the applications should load the public feed images in either a list or grid view.  
- The user should be able to enter a keyword in a search box and click on a search button and the app should return images with the relevant tags.
- Use of third-party libraries is encouraged.  We are especially interested in seeing how you leverage existing technologies to build a solution.

You can use the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) (or similar) to make your application look good.

Bonus points for implementing a "reactive" or "real-time" solution where results are updated as the user types (instead of requiring a search button as described in the basic challenge above).
